# Advent of Code 2019 - Day 3 Solution

Solution for Advent of Code 2019 - Day 3 Problems 1 & 2

## Overview

This problem took me a few hours to complete in Erlang even though I took a shortcut in the end to make up for a mistake I made in the beginning `NewIntersections = lists:delete({0,0}, Intersections),`.  Anyway, I am happy to be finished with this problem and to take all of the lessons learned so far into Day 4!

## How to run

1. Complete day3.erl
2. Solution to problem 1 `day3:find_closest_intersection().`
3. Solution to problem 2 `day3:fewest_steps_to_intersection().`
